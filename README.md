The name is Tristram and I develop strategies and implement controls to defend healthcare from malicious entities as well as validate security controls through penetration testing. However, like many of you, I have a common goal, which is to become the strongest version of myself as both a leader and professional. 

I strongly believe that knowledge sharing is the most important quality of any professional and it should be treated as a skillset as much as a mindset. It is my goal is to impart my knowledge from my own lessons learned, to help pave the way into someone else's journey into a red or blue team professional.

I wish you the best of luck on your journey to become the strongest version of yourself.
