My name is Tristram, and I specialize in developing security strategies to protect the healthcare industry from malicious threats. Although I primarily work as a blue teamer, I leverage penetration testing and create my own red team exercises to identify opportunities to enhance existing security controls.

Like many of you, I share the goal of becoming the strongest version of myself, both as a leader and a professional in my field. I firmly believe that knowledge sharing is an essential quality for any professional and should be valued as both a skillset and a mindset. This approach is vital for our industry's growth and for guiding others on their journey into red or blue team roles.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am committed to fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration. By sharing my insights and experiences, I aim to inspire and support others in achieving their full potential.

I wish you the best of luck on your journey to becoming the strongest version of yourself. Together, we can make a significant impact in safeguarding our digital world.
